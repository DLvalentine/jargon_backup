# Jargon File Backup
A backup of the [jargon file](http://catb.org/jargon/html/)

This has been immensely useful for me, personally, so I have downloaded the latest version (as of 06-01-18) to hang onto in a publically available repo.

Other repos exist that do something very similar, but I'd also like my own in the event that I want to plug it in or link it to a future blog project. I throw around the jargon a lot ;)
