# Jargon File Backup
A backup of the [jargon file](http://catb.org/jargon/html/)

This has been immensely useful for me, personally, so I have downloaded the latest version (as of the time of 
this file's last commit) to hang onto in a publically available repo.

Other repos exist that do something very similar, but I'd also like my own in the event that I want to plug it in or link it to a future blog project. I throw around the jargon a lot ;)


There's a script, `update.sh`, that can be run to use `wget` to pull the latest version for offline use. That is 
how I rip it, using tar to compress it for this repo.
